I was part of this effort, and helped move the company over from a php stack to a service oriented stack around node. We learnt a number of things along the way, and I'd like to share some of these with the rest of the community. We experimented heavily with parallelizing middleware stacks, isomorphic modules, in-house build/deploy systems, SEO-friendly single page applications, and so on. We managed to replace many servers with few, and have a fun ops setup that makes it quite nice to work with."
